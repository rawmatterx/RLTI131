# ATA 2025 OFFICIAL Risk Stratification Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the **official ATA 2025 Management Guidelines for Adult Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC)** in the I-131 Therapy Assistant. The implementation follows the **DATA framework** (Diagnosis, risk/benefit Assessment, Treatment decisions, response Assessment) and incorporates the evidence-based **4-tier risk stratification system**.

## ATA 2025 Key Features Implemented

### 1. DATA Framework Integration
- **D**iagnosis: TNM staging (8th edition) with accurate pT, pN, M categories
- **A**ssessment: 4-tier risk stratification for structural disease persistence/recurrence
- **T**reatment: Evidence-based treatment recommendations per risk tier
- **A**ssessment: Dynamic response evaluation (excellent, indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, structural incomplete)

### 2. Official 4-Tier Risk Stratification System

#### **LOW RISK (1-6% recurrence rate)**
- **Criteria:**
  - Unifocal papillary microcarcinoma (T1a PTC, <1 cm, intrathyroidal)
  - No aggressive features
  - Complete resection (R0)
  - No lymph node metastases
  
- **Management:**
  - De-escalated surveillance approach
  - RAI therapy generally not recommended
  - TSH suppression not routinely recommended
  - Less frequent follow-up intervals

#### **INTERMEDIATE-LOW RISK (3-9% recurrence rate)**
- **Criteria:**
  - Small volume lymph node metastases (â‰¤5 pathologic N1 micrometastases <0.2cm)
  - Intrathyroidal PTC 2-4cm
  - Multifocal microcarcinoma with microscopic ETE
  
- **Management:**
  - Standard follow-up protocol
  - RAI therapy may be considered
  - TSH suppression to lower normal range
  - Regular biochemical and imaging surveillance

#### **INTERMEDIATE-HIGH RISK (8-22% recurrence rate)**
- **Criteria:**
  - Aggressive histologic variants (tall cell, hobnail, columnar, diffuse sclerosing)
  - Vascular invasion in PTC/OTC
  - Intermediate volume lymph node metastases (Clinical N1 or >5 pathologic N1, all <3cm)
  - Microscopic extrathyroidal extension (MEE)
  - Intrathyroidal PTC >4cm
  - TERT promoter mutation alone
  - BRAF V600E mutation alone
  - Multifocal papillary microcarcinoma
  
- **Management:**
  - Selective approach with molecular-guided decisions
  - Moderate surveillance intensity
  - Consider RAI therapy based on risk-benefit analysis
  - Degree of TSH suppression based on response assessment

#### **HIGH RISK (27-75% recurrence rate)**
- **Criteria:**
  - Distant metastases (M1)
  - Gross extrathyroidal extension (T4a/T4b)
  - Incomplete tumor resection (R2)
  - Postoperative Tg suggestive of distant metastases
  - Large volume lymph node metastases (any â‰¥3cm)
  - Extranodal extension with significant nodal disease
  - Extensive vascular invasion in FTC (â‰¥4 vessels)
  - **Co-existent BRAF + TERT promoter mutations** (highest risk)
  - **Co-existent RAS + TERT promoter mutations**
  - Other high-risk molecular combinations (TP53, PIK3CA, AKT1, EIF1AX)
  
- **Management:**
  - Aggressive surgical approach with multidisciplinary team
  - Intensive surveillance protocol
  - Consider adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy
  - TSH suppression therapy
  - Molecular profiling for systemic therapy planning

### 3. Enhanced Molecular Profiling

#### **High-Risk Molecular Combinations:**
- **BRAF + TERT** combination: Associated with highest recurrence risk and aggressive behavior
- **RAS + TERT** combination: Significant predictor of aggressiveness
- **Other combinations**: TP53, PIK3CA, AKT1 mutations associated with dedifferentiation

#### **Individual Molecular Markers:**
- **BRAF V600E**: Most common mutation in PTC, intermediate risk factor
- **RAS mutations**: Associated with follicular pattern tumors
- **RET/PTC rearrangements**: More common in radiation-induced tumors
- **TERT promoter**: Strong predictor of aggressive behavior when combined

### 4. TNM Staging Integration (8th Edition)

#### **Primary Tumor (pT) Categories:**
- **T1a**: â‰¤1cm, intrathyroidal
- **T1b**: >1-2cm, intrathyroidal  
- **T2**: >2-4cm, intrathyroidal
- **T3a**: >4cm, intrathyroidal
- **T3b**: Minimal extrathyroidal extension (MEE) into strap muscles
- **T4a**: Gross extrathyroidal extension
- **T4b**: Advanced extrathyroidal extension

#### **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN):**
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis
- **N1a**: Central compartment (Level VI, VII)
- **N1b**: Lateral cervical lymph nodes

#### **Distant Metastasis (M):**
- **M0**: No distant metastasis
- **M1**: Distant metastasis present

### 5. Dynamic Response Assessment

#### **Response Categories:**
1. **Excellent Response** (<15% recurrence): Undetectable Tg, negative imaging
2. **Indeterminate Response** (~20% progression): Nonspecific findings
3. **Biochemical Incomplete** (up to 53% recurrence): Elevated Tg without structural disease
4. **Structural Incomplete** (67-75% recurrence): Persistent structural disease

1. **High Risk Evaluation**: Check for absolute high-risk criteria first
2. **Intermediate-High Assessment**: Evaluate aggressive features and molecular markers
